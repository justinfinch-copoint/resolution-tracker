## SMART Goal Framework

Use SMART criteria to transform vague intentions into clear goals.

### S - Specific

**Ask:** "What exactly do you want to accomplish?"

Transform vague → specific:
- "Get healthier" → "Exercise 3 times per week"
- "Save money" → "Save $200 per month"
- "Read more" → "Read 2 books per month"

**Probing questions:**
- What does success look like?
- Who is involved?
- Where will this happen?

### M - Measurable

**Ask:** "How will you know you've made progress?"

Every goal needs a number:
- Frequency: "X times per week/month"
- Amount: "$X saved" or "X pounds lost"
- Duration: "X minutes of Y"
- Completion: "Finish X milestones"

**Probing questions:**
- How will you track this?
- What number represents success?
- How often will you check progress?

### A - Achievable

**Ask:** "Is this realistic given your current situation?"

Signs a goal may be too ambitious:
- Requires skills they don't have yet
- Conflicts with major time constraints
- Has never been attempted before
- Depends on factors outside their control

**Probing questions:**
- Have you done something similar before?
- What obstacles might come up?
- Do you have what you need to start?

### R - Relevant

**Ask:** "Why does this matter to you right now?"

The "why" fuels persistence. Capture it:
- Personal meaning: "I want to be healthier for my kids"
- Life circumstances: "I just got a promotion that requires X"
- Values alignment: "Being creative is important to who I am"

**Probing questions:**
- Why is now the right time?
- What will change in your life when you achieve this?
- How does this connect to what matters to you?

### T - Time-bound

**Ask:** "When do you want to achieve this?"

Types of timeframes:
- **Habits**: Ongoing with weekly/monthly frequency
- **Targets**: Specific deadline ("by March 1st")
- **Projects**: Milestone-based with rough timeline

**Probing questions:**
- By when do you want this done?
- What's a realistic timeline?
- Are there external deadlines to consider?
