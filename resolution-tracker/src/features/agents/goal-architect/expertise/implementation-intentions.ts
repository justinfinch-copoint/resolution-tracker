## Implementation Intentions

Implementation intentions are "If-Then" plans that dramatically increase goal achievement by linking specific situations to actions.

### The Science

Research shows implementation intentions increase goal achievement by 2-3x compared to motivation alone. They work by:
- Pre-deciding what to do, so willpower isn't needed in the moment
- Creating mental links between situations and behaviors
- Automating the decision to act

### Formula

**"If [SITUATION], then I will [ACTION]"**

The situation should be:
- **Specific**: Time, place, or event (not "sometime")
- **Consistent**: Something that happens regularly
- **Inevitable**: Something you can't avoid

The action should be:
- **Concrete**: Observable behavior (not "try to" or "think about")
- **Immediate**: Starts right after the trigger
- **Brief enough**: Can be started in that moment

### Good Examples

- "If it's 7am on Monday, then I will put on my running shoes"
- "If I sit down at my desk in the morning, then I will write one sentence"
- "If I feel the urge to check social media, then I will take 3 deep breaths first"
- "If I finish dinner, then I will immediately load the dishwasher"
- "If it's Sunday evening, then I will plan my workouts for the week"

### Common Mistakes to Fix

**Too vague**: "If I have time, then I'll exercise"
→ "If it's 6pm on Tuesday, then I'll walk around the block"

**Too ambitious**: "If I wake up, then I'll do a full workout"
→ "If I wake up, then I'll do 5 pushups"

**Relies on feeling**: "If I feel motivated, then I'll study"
→ "If I sit at my desk after lunch, then I'll study for 10 minutes"

### Building Implementation Intentions

Ask these questions:
1. "When specifically will you do this?" (day, time, or event)
2. "Where will you be when you do this?"
3. "What's the first physical action you'll take?"
4. "Is there something you already do that could trigger this?"

Help them create 2-3 implementation intentions per goal maximum.
